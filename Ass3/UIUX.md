- The navbar is consistent throughout each page which allows users to easily navigate throughout the site
- I kept an aesthetic and minimalist design to prevent distract the users and avoided using harsh colours for users with visual impairments
- When viewing the listing, the images are not on autoplay.
    - aids user with lower motor skills to have control of the images
    - Does not have fast flashing for visually impaired users
- When a user wants edit their listing, some information are already filled out so they have do it manually, increasing efficiency
